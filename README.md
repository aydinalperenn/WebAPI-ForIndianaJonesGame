# WebAPI-ForDartGame
Visual Studio API C# project prepared according to Layered Architecture and Object Oriented Programming principles.

- This project is a multi-table version of the WebAPI-ForDartGame project created for the Indiana Jones game.

- For it to work, make the SQL call in the PlayersDbContext.cs class using your own database information.

- To run the project, your database must be created manually by you, or migrated through the project (easier).

- To use it, revise the project according to your database tables and columns.
